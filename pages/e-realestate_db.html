<h3>Realestate DB</h3>
<p>
  This code was developed as a learning exercise to practice PHP and MySQL. The
  code you see has been preserved as originally written to reflect the learning
  process and thought patterns at the time.

<h4>Key Points Summary</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Self-contained script: One file handles connection, views, forms, and
    actions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Separation: Configuration (zugang.php), presentation (HTML via echo), and
    logic (CRUD).
  </li>
  <li>
    No Dependency on Frameworks: The only prerequisites are PHP ≥ 8.2 and MySQL;
    there’s zero reliance on Composer packages or front-end frameworks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Client-Side Confirmation: The “delete” action uses an
    onsubmit="confirm(...)" popup rather than a server-roundtrip for
    confirmation, trading off simplicity for UX clarity.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Future Considerations</h4>
<p>Once deployed on a server with backend support, this prototype could be
  developed into a fully featured, interactive real estate database.

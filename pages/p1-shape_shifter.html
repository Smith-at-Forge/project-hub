</p>

<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>
  The goal of this project was to develop a 2D action-platformer featuring a
  <strong>unique mechanic:</strong> the ability for the player character to shapeshift. Each form
  grants temporary, ability-specific powers that can be used to overcome
  level-based obstacles and puzzles. The mechanic is designed to encourage
  experimentation, timing, and adaptability.
</p>

<h4>Project Status</h4>
<p>
  Prototype completed. The team successfully developed a <strong>playable prototype</strong> that
  demonstrates core gameplay mechanics, including character transformation,
  basic level design, and visual/audio feedback loops.

<h4>Project Timeline</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Start date:</strong> 2024-11-16</li>
  <li><strong>Completion date:</strong> 2025-03-19</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technologies Used</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Game Engine:</strong> Unity (C#)</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Graphics &amp; Tools:</strong> Aseprite, GIMP, custom-built
    animation pipeline
  </li>
  <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Git (GitHub)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Team Structure</h4>
<p>
  The development team consisted of four members with clearly defined roles:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Project Lead / Game Design:</strong> Overall coordination, mechanic
    design, visual direction
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Admin / Level Design:</strong> Environment design, puzzle layout,
    testing framework
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Programmer 1 / UI Design:</strong> Core gameplay systems, user
    interface implementation
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Programmer 2 / Sound Design:</strong> Audio assets, transformation
    logic, scene transitions
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Retrospective Notes</h4>
<p>
  Initially, the team aimed to complete a full-featured vertical slice of the
  game. However, given the limited timeframe and the lack of prior game
  development experience within the team, the scope was adjusted mid-project.
  The revised goal focused on building a solid and testable prototype to
  validate the core gameplay mechanic and project feasibility.
